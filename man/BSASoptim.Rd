\title{Implementation of the Beetle Swarm Antennae Search (BSAS) algorithm for optimization problems.}
\usage{
BSASoptim(fn, init = NULL, lower = c(-6, 0), upper = c(-1, 2), k = 5,
  d0 = 0.001, d1 = 3, eta_d = 0.95, l0 = 0, l1 = 0, eta_l = 0.95,
  step = 0.8, eta_step = 0.95, n = 200, seed = NULL, trace = T,
  steptol = 0.01, p_min = 0.2, p_step = 0.2, n_flag = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{fn}{objective function; function need to be optimized}

\item{init}{default = NULL, it will generate randomly; Of course, you can specify it.}

\item{lower}{lower of parameters to be estimated; Default = c(-6,0) because of the test on 
Michalewicz function of which thelower is c(-6,0); By the way, you should set one of 
\emph{init} or \emph{lower} parameter at least to make the code know the dimensionality 
of your problem.}

\item{upper}{upper of parameters; Default = c(-1,2).}

\item{k}{a positive integer.\emph{k} is the number of beetles for exploring in every iteration.}

\item{d0}{a constant to gurantee that sensing length of antennae \emph{d} doesn't equal to
zero. More specifically, \deqn{d^t = \eta_d * d^{t-1} + d_0}where attenuation coefficient
 \eqn{\eta_d} belongs to \eqn{[0,1]}}

\item{d1}{initial value of antenae length. You can specify it according to your problem scale}

\item{eta_d}{attenuation coefficient of sensing length of antennae}

\item{l0}{position jitter factor constant.Default = 0.}

\item{l1}{initial position jitter factor.Default = 0.\deqn{x = x - step \* dir \* sign(fnleft - fnright) + l \*random(npars)}}

\item{eta_l}{attenuation coefficient of jitter factor.\deqn{l^t = \eta_l * l^{t-1} + l_0}}

\item{step}{initial step-size of beetle}

\item{eta_step}{attenuation coefficient of step-size.\deqn{step^t = \eta_step * step^{t-1}}}

\item{n}{iterations times}

\item{seed}{random seed; default = NULL ; The results of BAS depend on random init value and random directions.
Therefore, if you set a random seed, for example,\code{seed = 1}, the results will remain the same
no matter how many times you repeat your experiments.}

\item{trace}{default = T; trace the process of BAS iteration.}

\item{steptol}{default = 0.01; Iteration will stop if step-size in current moment is less than
steptol.}

\item{p_min}{a constant belongs to [0,1]. If random generated value is lager than p_min and there are better positions
in \emph{k} beetles than current position, the next position of beetle will be the best position in \emph{k} beetles.
\deqn{x_{best} = argmin(fn(x_i^t))}
where \eqn{i belongs [1,2,...,k]}
If random generated value is smaller than(<=) p_min and there are better positions in \emph{k} beetles than current position,
the next position of the beetle could be the random position within better positions.}

\item{p_step}{a constant belongs to [0,1].If  no better position in \emph{k} beetles than current position,
there is still a samll probability that step-size doesn't update. If you set a little \emph{k}, you could set p_step
slightly large.}

\item{n_flag}{an positive integer; default = 2; If step-size doesn't update for successive n_flag times because p_step is 
larger than random generated value, the step-size will be forced updating. If you set a large p_step, set a small n_flag
is suggested.}
